1
00:01:17,497 --> 00:01:22,210
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!
Oh, yeah!

2
00:01:22,294 --> 00:01:25,589
Okay, you're great.

3
00:01:25,672 --> 00:01:28,717
- You got the line?
- Yeah. Come on up, slowpoke.

4
00:01:34,806 --> 00:01:38,393
Help!

5
00:01:39,769 --> 00:01:43,523
You okay? You know,
we're 50 miles from anybody.

6
00:01:43,607 --> 00:01:46,526
- Who are you screamin' for?
- You!

7
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:49,029
Come on.

8
00:01:50,113 --> 00:01:52,407
Just pull me up!

9
00:01:54,826 --> 00:01:56,787
Rich?

10
00:01:58,455 --> 00:02:00,749
Just pull me up.

11
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:07,214
All right, don't be a dick,
Richie. I need a pull.

12
00:02:07,297 --> 00:02:09,424
Rich?

13
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:12,219
Rich?

14
00:02:13,971 --> 00:02:16,598
What...

15
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,101
When you plant seed
into your own kin, you anger God.

16
00:05:45,185 --> 00:05:50,440
Still have not been
able to locate the two college students.

17
00:05:50,523 --> 00:05:54,443
Richard Stoker and Halley Smith
have been missing since last Monday...

18
00:05:54,526 --> 00:05:56,613
after failing to return
from a weekend of rock...

19
00:07:07,768 --> 00:07:10,354
- Hey. How are you doin'?

20
00:07:10,437 --> 00:07:13,856
Do you have any idea
what's going on up here?

21
00:07:15,191 --> 00:07:17,611
Tractor jackknifed
about five mile up.

22
00:07:17,695 --> 00:07:19,904
Spilled chemicals and shit
all over the road.

23
00:07:19,946 --> 00:07:22,241
Any idea how long
it'll take to clean up?

24
00:07:22,324 --> 00:07:26,077
- Couple hours.
- Couple hours?

25
00:07:26,119 --> 00:07:29,248
You in a hurry?

26
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:32,752
Yeah. I need to get
to Raleigh tonight.

27
00:07:32,835 --> 00:07:35,670
- What you oughta do
is get back in your car,
- Mm-hmm.

28
00:07:35,754 --> 00:07:38,049
Fix your hair a couple
hundred more times...

29
00:07:38,132 --> 00:07:40,925
Thank you.

30
00:08:03,448 --> 00:08:07,120
Hey, Doris.
This is Chris Flynn.

31
00:08:07,203 --> 00:08:09,956
I have a 7:00 p.m.
Interview with Mr. Keller.

32
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:12,500
I'm, uh, running
about 30 minutes late.

33
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:14,793
- I was wondering if you could...

34
00:08:14,877 --> 00:08:17,839
Hello? Hello?

35
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,633
I'm not gonna make this.

36
00:09:08,556 --> 00:09:11,726
Excuse me, sir.
Do you have a pay phone?

37
00:09:23,821 --> 00:09:27,701
Uh, this one's not working. Do you
have another phone I could use?

38
00:09:27,743 --> 00:09:30,746
Long distance?

39
00:09:30,787 --> 00:09:33,373
What isn't long distance
from here, right?

40
00:09:33,415 --> 00:09:35,374
You cuttin' wise
with me, son?

41
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:38,879
No, sir, I'm just...
I'm runnin' behind...

42
00:09:38,962 --> 00:09:41,882
and I really need
to make a call.

43
00:09:41,924 --> 00:09:44,718
Well, that'n there
is my only phone.

44
00:09:44,801 --> 00:09:46,845
Right.

45
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:52,893
Well, uh, the highway's
really jammed up.

46
00:09:52,935 --> 00:09:55,437
Do you know of another
route heading south?

47
00:09:55,521 --> 00:09:58,232
- No.
- No.

48
00:10:04,863 --> 00:10:07,448
Why is this Bear Mountain Road
dotted like this?

49
00:10:07,532 --> 00:10:10,244
- Dirt.
- Dirt road?

50
00:10:10,285 --> 00:10:13,539
'Fraid they ain't got around
to pavin' it yet.

51
00:10:13,622 --> 00:10:17,209
It looks like it runs into the highway
about 15, 20 miles. Is that right?

52
00:10:17,293 --> 00:10:19,420
If you say so.

53
00:10:21,505 --> 00:10:24,800
It could work.
Thank you very much.

54
00:10:24,884 --> 00:10:26,886
You take care, okay?

55
00:10:38,314 --> 00:10:42,109
You're the one
gonna need to take care.

56
00:12:10,073 --> 00:12:12,409
Wejust got nailed, man.!

57
00:12:12,492 --> 00:12:15,203
- Jesus Christ.!
- Shit.!

58
00:12:15,287 --> 00:12:17,539
- Goddamn drunken hillbilly!
- Hey. Hey, you all right?

59
00:12:17,581 --> 00:12:21,042
I'm so sorry.
I was just...

60
00:12:21,084 --> 00:12:23,086
- Jesus.
- I was just comin' around the bend.

61
00:12:23,128 --> 00:12:25,922
- I didn't even see... I got distracted.
- My God, you could've died!

62
00:12:26,006 --> 00:12:28,717
- Are you guys all okay?
- Yeah, yeah. You wanna sit down?

63
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,344
- You might be in shock.
- What were you doing
driving so goddamn fast?

64
00:12:31,428 --> 00:12:34,556
- All right, all right.
- Why was your truck parked
in the middle of the road?

65
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,725
Because we blew out
our tires, asshole!

66
00:12:36,767 --> 00:12:40,562
- I'll pay for whatever damage was done.
- That's my mom's car!

67
00:12:40,604 --> 00:12:42,606
All right, Frannie.
The man said he'd pay for...

68
00:12:42,647 --> 00:12:45,400
Oh, looks like you killed
my bike here too.

69
00:12:45,484 --> 00:12:49,029
I'm sorry. L...
How did you blow out your tires?

70
00:12:49,112 --> 00:12:51,573
Someone left some barbed wire
in the middle of the road.

71
00:12:51,657 --> 00:12:54,117
I can't believe someone
just dropped it there.

72
00:12:54,201 --> 00:12:57,454
Nobody dropped anything.

73
00:12:57,537 --> 00:12:59,748
I just found this tied to a tree.
Somebody did this.

74
00:12:59,831 --> 00:13:02,751
Southern hospitality at its finest.

75
00:13:02,793 --> 00:13:05,420
- Redneck assholes.
- I'm gonna try and find a phone.

76
00:13:05,462 --> 00:13:08,257
I think I saw a gas station
like a couple miles back.

77
00:13:08,298 --> 00:13:10,968
- I'm gonna come with you.
- There is no phone.

78
00:13:11,052 --> 00:13:14,471
- I was just there.
- Why don't we just wait for
someone else to come along?

79
00:13:14,513 --> 00:13:16,808
What, like Speed Racer here?

80
00:13:16,891 --> 00:13:21,145
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Okay, you guys go, and
we'll just stay here, Francine.

81
00:13:21,228 --> 00:13:24,315
- And get high.
- Yeah. So what?

82
00:13:24,398 --> 00:13:26,608
- Careful. They don't like stoners.
- Who are you calling a stoner?

83
00:13:26,692 --> 00:13:28,902
- Your mom.
- Hey, what's your name?

84
00:13:28,986 --> 00:13:30,779
Chris Flynn.

85
00:13:30,863 --> 00:13:33,241
You hurt, Chris Flynn?

86
00:13:33,325 --> 00:13:36,327
- No, I'm fine.
- Good.

87
00:13:38,496 --> 00:13:41,290
- 'Cause you're the mule.
- Oh, no.

88
00:13:41,373 --> 00:13:44,585
You know, I can carry that. You just
had the whole car accident thing.

89
00:13:44,668 --> 00:13:47,046
Yeah, we'll just stay here
and maybe get hit again.

90
00:13:47,129 --> 00:13:49,257
- Are you guys sure you're cool?
- Yeah.

91
00:13:49,341 --> 00:13:51,634
Yeah, we'll be just fine.
Thank you.

92
00:13:51,717 --> 00:13:55,638
- Mess you up.
- Yeah, smoke it up there, uh, Skippy.

93
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:58,808
- Yeah, have fun.
- I don't fuckin'believe this.

94
00:14:01,644 --> 00:14:03,938
Your mom's gonna kick your ass.

95
00:14:05,732 --> 00:14:08,359
God, I cannot get out of my head
what just happened.

96
00:14:08,442 --> 00:14:12,154
- Are you sure you're all right? Yeah?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

97
00:14:12,238 --> 00:14:14,574
What are you guys
doing out here?

98
00:14:14,657 --> 00:14:17,827
Uh, uh, oh, camping.
Uh, I don't know. Actually, we're lost.

99
00:14:17,869 --> 00:14:21,999
You know, a lot of people say...
who have been through similar
traumatic experiences...

100
00:14:22,082 --> 00:14:26,545
that the following moments kind of feel
like you're moving kind of in slow motion.

101
00:14:26,628 --> 00:14:28,880
- Do you feel like that?
- No.

102
00:14:28,963 --> 00:14:32,634
I should tell you that my voice
is fairly low and normal speed.

103
00:14:37,473 --> 00:14:41,476
- Pretty good.
- Mm-hmm.

104
00:14:45,146 --> 00:14:47,231
Where'd you get this?

105
00:14:47,315 --> 00:14:50,193
Um, I got it out of my
dad's room, actually.

106
00:14:50,276 --> 00:14:53,531
- You can finish it.

107
00:14:57,951 --> 00:15:00,370
I can't believe
they called us stoners.

108
00:15:00,453 --> 00:15:03,498
Dickheads.

109
00:15:03,581 --> 00:15:06,543
Are you sure
you know where we're going?

110
00:15:06,584 --> 00:15:09,379
Yeah. There was a map
at the gas station.

111
00:15:09,421 --> 00:15:11,506
Oh, I'm so tired already.

112
00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:14,759
I'm starving,
and I'm being eaten by ants.

113
00:15:14,843 --> 00:15:16,886
Are there any on my back?

114
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:20,433
No, nothing there.
Oh, hey-ho! I call it. Uh, squirrel.

115
00:15:20,474 --> 00:15:23,935
- Well, you said you were hungry, Carly.
- I don't think it's a squirrel.

116
00:15:23,977 --> 00:15:26,981
- It's a mink.
- Really? How do you know?

117
00:15:27,064 --> 00:15:29,357
- Probably ran over it.

118
00:15:29,441 --> 00:15:33,695
In medical school, they make you
work on animal cadavers
before you get to the real thing.

119
00:15:33,778 --> 00:15:35,697
- It's a mink.
- Oh.

120
00:15:37,325 --> 00:15:39,534
It's a mink?

121
00:15:39,618 --> 00:15:42,205
I need to be in Raleigh by 7:00.

122
00:15:42,288 --> 00:15:45,248
Hmm. Better get
a move-on, then.

123
00:15:45,373 --> 00:15:47,877
You know, we should've
just taken her to New York.

124
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,463
No. You know how she loves
this outdoor stuff.

125
00:15:51,546 --> 00:15:53,508
Yeah.

126
00:15:53,591 --> 00:15:56,426
If you ask me, though,
nature sucks.

127
00:15:56,468 --> 00:16:01,431
Well, the next time she gets dumped,
we'll take her to New York.

128
00:16:04,811 --> 00:16:07,104
Drop your pants.

129
00:16:07,187 --> 00:16:09,607
What?

130
00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:11,733
When do people
always show up, Evan?

131
00:16:11,817 --> 00:16:14,487
What are we doing?

132
00:16:14,571 --> 00:16:16,905
Consider it an experiment
in probability theory.

133
00:16:16,989 --> 00:16:18,907
Really?

134
00:16:21,494 --> 00:16:24,455
Mmm. I love you.

135
00:16:24,496 --> 00:16:26,458
I know.

136
00:16:26,499 --> 00:16:29,752
Now get them
trousers off, boy. Don't be a sissy.

137
00:16:29,835 --> 00:16:32,671
- All right.

138
00:16:34,506 --> 00:16:38,427
You know, I've been thinking
about this whole wedding thing...

139
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,971
and I think we should
take a trip down to Mexico.

140
00:16:41,013 --> 00:16:44,058
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm talking about a long weekend...

141
00:16:44,141 --> 00:16:48,438
margaritas, the two of us
on a beach alone, sunset.

142
00:16:48,521 --> 00:16:52,901
And, you know,
I'm talking about just, just eloping.

143
00:16:52,984 --> 00:16:56,946
- You know what I mean?
- Uh, wait a second.

144
00:16:57,029 --> 00:16:59,366
You wanna know what I think?

145
00:16:59,449 --> 00:17:01,367
Yes, please.

146
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:05,122
- I think if you ever
want to get in my pants again,
- Affirmative.

147
00:17:05,205 --> 00:17:07,873
This is the last time
you use the "E" word.

148
00:17:07,957 --> 00:17:11,961
Okay? Okay.

149
00:17:12,044 --> 00:17:14,214
Yeah, it's a disgusting word.

150
00:17:14,298 --> 00:17:16,382
Hey, guys, hold on.

151
00:17:19,469 --> 00:17:22,513
Hey, is anyone up there?

152
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,226
Hello!

153
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:30,147
- There must be people nearby.
- Anyone up there?

154
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:34,192
- Somebody had to start it.

155
00:17:34,275 --> 00:17:36,236
Let's keep moving.

156
00:17:38,738 --> 00:17:40,657
Hello?

157
00:17:45,244 --> 00:17:47,498
Freaky.

158
00:17:51,543 --> 00:17:54,712
Oh, look at this.
It's fucked!

159
00:17:54,796 --> 00:17:58,342
Nothing. Nothing.

160
00:18:02,054 --> 00:18:04,056
Hey, did you find
anything to eat?

161
00:18:04,139 --> 00:18:06,724
They took all my Power Bars.

162
00:18:06,766 --> 00:18:09,562
Um, no.

163
00:18:09,603 --> 00:18:13,190
No. Sorry.

164
00:18:16,943 --> 00:18:20,740
Damn it. Scott and Carly
took all our friggin' sunscreen.

165
00:18:23,158 --> 00:18:25,369
Does he have any good CD's?

166
00:18:26,745 --> 00:18:30,583
Mmm. Definitely not.

167
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:38,423
You know, I think this guy
must be some kind of doctor.

168
00:18:38,465 --> 00:18:42,470
Maybe we could get him to write us
some prescriptions when he gets back.

169
00:18:42,553 --> 00:18:45,681
He doesn't have
any smokes either.

170
00:18:45,765 --> 00:18:47,725
Almost out.

171
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,860
Evan?

172
00:19:09,497 --> 00:19:12,041
Evan? Where are you?

173
00:19:13,918 --> 00:19:16,128
Hey, baby,
what are you doing?

174
00:19:16,169 --> 00:19:20,967
I'm just... amusing myself.
Whoooo!

175
00:19:21,009 --> 00:19:23,803
You, uh, getting
anything there, chatty?

176
00:19:23,887 --> 00:19:26,222
No, nothing.
I'm gonna miss this thing.

177
00:19:26,306 --> 00:19:30,477
- Why didn't you just fly?
- I put all of my money
into that car back there.

178
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,981
Okay, forget eloping, but there is an idea we
should discuss about the band for our wedding.

179
00:19:35,064 --> 00:19:39,319
I think we should hire a... you know,
a Frank Sinatra-type, uh, lead singer...

180
00:19:39,402 --> 00:19:42,572
as opposed to
a James Brown-type lead singer...

181
00:19:42,655 --> 00:19:45,575
because, you know, really, let's be
honest, there's only oneJames Brown...

182
00:19:45,659 --> 00:19:48,994
and, you know, a faux James Brown
is really quite intolerable.

183
00:19:52,874 --> 00:19:56,628
Evan? Where are you?

184
00:19:56,711 --> 00:19:59,838
You pissing or something?

185
00:20:05,469 --> 00:20:07,389
Evan?

186
00:20:37,251 --> 00:20:41,548
You know, plus he'd be grinding his hips,
and my grandmother would be...

187
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:46,720
yes, revolted
but also strangely fascinated
in a completely disturbing way...

188
00:20:46,804 --> 00:20:49,264
and, um...

189
00:20:51,433 --> 00:20:53,393
Baby?

190
00:20:55,938 --> 00:20:58,815
Carly, I wa...
I was kidding.

191
00:20:58,898 --> 00:21:01,527
Carly?

192
00:21:04,989 --> 00:21:07,908
- Evan?

193
00:21:34,518 --> 00:21:37,897
Sweetheart?
Hey, guys, hold up!

194
00:21:37,938 --> 00:21:41,484
Guys, hold up
for a second, all right?

195
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:45,237
Baby, seriously,
this isn't funny.

196
00:21:47,073 --> 00:21:49,492
- Jesus God!

197
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:52,495
- Baby!

198
00:21:52,578 --> 00:21:56,249
- L...
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

199
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:59,168
I could've killed you, woman.
I'm-I'm extremely dangerous.

200
00:21:59,252 --> 00:22:01,963
You wanna know
why I love you so much?

201
00:22:02,046 --> 00:22:04,172
Because you're so fun
to play with.

202
00:22:04,257 --> 00:22:07,301
Is that why you love me?
That really scared me, baby.

203
00:22:07,385 --> 00:22:10,513
- I'm sorry.
- That really scared me.
Would you not do that?

204
00:22:10,596 --> 00:22:13,015
Hello.!

205
00:22:15,518 --> 00:22:17,979
Hello.!

206
00:22:21,149 --> 00:22:24,611
There's, uh, nothing
like stating the obvious, huh?

207
00:22:24,694 --> 00:22:28,990
- Hey, baby, look at this.

208
00:22:29,073 --> 00:22:33,828
Whoo! Hey, Carly, I think
this would be good time for you
to confront your fear of...

209
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:37,165
Don't!
Okay, that is not funny.

210
00:22:37,207 --> 00:22:39,375
Look who's scared now.

211
00:22:43,046 --> 00:22:45,006
- Sorry.
- Whatever.

212
00:22:45,048 --> 00:22:48,051
Just get me to a motel room...

213
00:22:48,134 --> 00:22:50,303
run me a very hot bath...

214
00:22:50,345 --> 00:22:54,015
and be prepared to provide me
with a lot of orgasms.

215
00:22:54,099 --> 00:22:57,519
- Oh!
- I think they need to be alone.

216
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,355
What do you expect?
They just got engaged.

217
00:23:00,438 --> 00:23:02,565
They're happy.
It's a hard thing to find.

218
00:23:02,649 --> 00:23:04,568
Yeah.

219
00:23:04,651 --> 00:23:06,695
- Got it?
- Limber tongue. Got it.

220
00:23:06,778 --> 00:23:08,697
You're stupid.

221
00:23:19,249 --> 00:23:22,043
Maybe we shouldn't
have left Francine and Evan.

222
00:23:22,085 --> 00:23:24,588
Don't worry. They're fine.

223
00:23:24,671 --> 00:23:27,758
- You guys okay?
- Super.

224
00:23:31,595 --> 00:23:34,431
Well, wait, guys.
This road isn't on here.

225
00:23:34,514 --> 00:23:37,392
That's because you don't have
the Redneck World Atlas.

226
00:23:37,476 --> 00:23:41,272
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. I think
we've just been saved, kids.

227
00:23:41,356 --> 00:23:43,482
- Can I get a...

228
00:23:51,156 --> 00:23:54,827
- Make this quick.

229
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:57,539
Actually, maybe we
should keep walking.

230
00:23:57,622 --> 00:24:00,874
What? The next house is gonna have
a white picket fence?

231
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:03,378
Yeah, if there is
a next house.

232
00:24:06,046 --> 00:24:08,258
- Hey.
- What?

233
00:24:25,608 --> 00:24:28,027
Hello?

234
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:31,030
All right, this isn't right.

235
00:24:31,113 --> 00:24:33,032
Hello?

236
00:24:38,704 --> 00:24:41,333
Hello? Anybody home?

237
00:24:44,043 --> 00:24:46,129
- Whoa, baby! Could you... Shh!

238
00:24:46,213 --> 00:24:48,756
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

239
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:52,635
I was gonna see if they had a phone.
You guys can wait out here if you want.

240
00:24:52,718 --> 00:24:55,304
You can't just go barging
into someone's house like that.

241
00:24:55,388 --> 00:24:58,140
Yeah, 'cause, you know,
I'm just thinkin'...

242
00:24:58,182 --> 00:25:00,851
West Virginia, trespassing...
not a great combination.

243
00:25:00,935 --> 00:25:03,187
Look, I need to pee.

244
00:25:03,271 --> 00:25:06,190
Well, I need to remind you
of a little movie called Deliverance.

245
00:25:09,485 --> 00:25:12,990
Guys, we got two wrecked cars.
I mean, we really need a phone.

246
00:25:21,622 --> 00:25:23,876
Hello?

247
00:25:23,959 --> 00:25:26,336
Hello?

248
00:25:26,419 --> 00:25:28,379
Carly.

249
00:25:34,177 --> 00:25:36,137
Hello?

250
00:25:51,946 --> 00:25:53,863
What the fuck?

251
00:25:53,947 --> 00:25:56,951
Let's just do
what we gotta do and get out ofhere.

252
00:25:59,953 --> 00:26:03,206
Hey, I am not sensing a phone here.

253
00:26:03,248 --> 00:26:05,500
Hello!

254
00:26:05,542 --> 00:26:08,170
Okay, who lives here?

255
00:26:08,212 --> 00:26:12,008
I don't know, but can you
help me find a bathroom?

256
00:26:12,049 --> 00:26:14,175
Baby, I think
this is the bathroom.

257
00:26:14,259 --> 00:26:19,015
Oh, fuck.

258
00:26:21,057 --> 00:26:23,895
Oh, my God.
Look at this place.

259
00:26:23,978 --> 00:26:26,730
Seriously, guys,
I think we should go.

260
00:26:26,813 --> 00:26:29,066
Help me find the bathroom.
Then we'll go.

261
00:26:29,108 --> 00:26:31,693
Baby, what if this place
belongs to some kind of cult?

262
00:26:31,735 --> 00:26:34,405
I read in Newsweek how
economically depressed places...

263
00:26:34,489 --> 00:26:37,699
are like breeding grounds for
all kinds of apocalyptic visionaries.

264
00:26:37,741 --> 00:26:40,536
Order of the Solar Temple, Church of
the Lamb of God, the Chijon family.

265
00:26:40,578 --> 00:26:43,038
- Remember them?
- Hey, brainiac!

266
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,041
Shh!

267
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:49,044
All right.
Maybe that door.

268
00:26:58,011 --> 00:27:00,431
- Christ!

269
00:27:00,473 --> 00:27:03,934
- You okay?
- It's just a paddle. It's all right.

270
00:27:07,772 --> 00:27:10,315
Whoa.

271
00:27:12,777 --> 00:27:15,404
God, look at this place.

272
00:27:15,446 --> 00:27:18,283
Yeah. It's like
the garage sale from hell.

273
00:27:18,366 --> 00:27:20,909
- Jesus.

274
00:27:22,996 --> 00:27:25,789
Can you believe this?

275
00:27:28,752 --> 00:27:32,338
Jesus, these guys
are ripping people off.

276
00:27:32,421 --> 00:27:36,842
I mean, this is like
$30,000 worth of stuff.

277
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:42,139
- Chris.
- Mm-hmm.

278
00:27:42,223 --> 00:27:44,684
We should leave.

279
00:27:46,602 --> 00:27:49,147
This is kind of creepy.

280
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:55,445
- Yeah, this is it.
- Okay. Be quick.

281
00:27:55,487 --> 00:27:58,155
- Okay!
- All right? Two minutes.

282
00:27:58,239 --> 00:28:00,325
All right?
I'll be here.

283
00:29:08,309 --> 00:29:10,229
Ew.!

284
00:29:52,437 --> 00:29:54,482
Guys, guys, check this out.

285
00:29:56,067 --> 00:29:57,401
Oh, no.

286
00:30:01,155 --> 00:30:04,242
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Scott. Scott!

287
00:30:04,284 --> 00:30:06,911
- - Scott, we have to go now!

288
00:30:08,495 --> 00:30:10,748
- Jess! Jessie!
- Jess!

289
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:14,001
- Hey! Guys, what is it?
- We need to get back to your friends.

290
00:30:14,084 --> 00:30:15,253
- What about a phone?
- There is no phone. Shit!

291
00:30:15,253 --> 00:30:16,963
- What about a phone?
- There is no phone. Shit!

292
00:30:19,298 --> 00:30:22,635
There's a back door.
I saw a back door. Come on.

293
00:30:22,677 --> 00:30:24,636
- Go, go!

294
00:30:24,678 --> 00:30:29,475
- Okay, hurry. Shit! No!
- Shit!

295
00:30:29,558 --> 00:30:34,521
Scott.! Scott.!
It's not gonna budge.! Come on.!

296
00:36:47,775 --> 00:36:50,151
Go.

297
00:37:03,874 --> 00:37:05,418
Go.

298
00:37:20,516 --> 00:37:24,061
Go! Go!

299
00:37:24,144 --> 00:37:26,773
- Go! Go!
- Go! Go! Go! Go!

300
00:37:26,856 --> 00:37:29,691
- Go, you guys! Run!

301
00:37:29,733 --> 00:37:32,445
- Go quickly.
- Come on.

302
00:37:40,577 --> 00:37:43,081
- Where are they going?
- I don't know.

303
00:37:43,122 --> 00:37:46,542
Jesus, did that
really just happen?

304
00:37:46,583 --> 00:37:49,127
Do you think Evan's okay?

305
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,633
- Please.
- I can't. I can't.

306
00:37:54,716 --> 00:37:56,802
Carly, come on!
Get up!

307
00:37:56,885 --> 00:38:00,139
You didn't see what
they did to Francine!

308
00:38:00,222 --> 00:38:04,269
- You didn't see what we saw!
- Carly! Carly! Sweet pea!

309
00:38:04,352 --> 00:38:06,895
Look at me. We are gonna
get out of this, I swear to you.

310
00:38:06,979 --> 00:38:10,483
We are. Okay? We're gonna find a road.
We're gonna get to a town.

311
00:38:10,567 --> 00:38:15,113
And we're going home.
We're gonna get married. All right?

312
00:38:15,196 --> 00:38:17,823
And we are never
going into the woods again.

313
00:38:19,326 --> 00:38:21,494
- All right?
- We gotta go.

314
00:38:21,577 --> 00:38:24,331
- Come on. This way!
- Let's go! Come on!

315
00:38:39,011 --> 00:38:40,972
What is this?

316
00:38:51,525 --> 00:38:53,610
Jesus.

317
00:38:55,361 --> 00:38:57,322
All these people.

318
00:38:59,074 --> 00:39:02,703
Baby. Fuck.

319
00:39:07,331 --> 00:39:10,668
How can they do this?
I don't understand.

320
00:39:10,751 --> 00:39:14,840
- How'd they get away with this?
- Oh, my God. All these people.

321
00:39:14,923 --> 00:39:18,844
Maybe one of them still runs.
Look for keys.

322
00:39:18,927 --> 00:39:21,180
None of these cars
are gonna run.

323
00:39:21,305 --> 00:39:25,017
Come on. Look at them.
Oh, fuck.

324
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:34,360
Get down! Get down!

325
00:39:34,443 --> 00:39:36,237
- Come on!
- Okay.

326
00:40:10,104 --> 00:40:12,398
What do we do?

327
00:40:12,481 --> 00:40:14,692
- They left their truck running.
- So?

328
00:40:14,734 --> 00:40:17,360
- We gotta take it.
- How are we supposed to do that?

329
00:40:17,403 --> 00:40:20,406
One of us leads them
in the wrong direction...

330
00:40:20,489 --> 00:40:23,618
and the rest commandeer the truck
so they'll run for the runner.

331
00:40:25,369 --> 00:40:27,370
It's a classic military move.

332
00:40:27,412 --> 00:40:30,208
- Who goes?
- Me.

333
00:40:30,249 --> 00:40:34,045
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

334
00:40:34,087 --> 00:40:36,923
Over here!

335
00:40:44,472 --> 00:40:47,976
- Oh, shit. Oh, God.

336
00:40:50,603 --> 00:40:52,897
- Go!

337
00:40:52,939 --> 00:40:56,568
Listen. Help him. Get to the truck.
I'll meet you there.

338
00:40:56,651 --> 00:40:58,403
I love you.

339
00:40:58,444 --> 00:41:02,407
Fuckers!
Asshole motherfuckers!

340
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:04,575
Assholes!

341
00:41:07,162 --> 00:41:09,080
He's okay. Shh, shh.

342
00:41:20,175 --> 00:41:22,469
Come on.

343
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:32,478
Here, here. You're okay.

344
00:41:34,439 --> 00:41:37,316
Go ahead. Go, go, go.
Go to the truck.

345
00:41:41,112 --> 00:41:43,990
- Come on. We gotta go.

346
00:41:44,032 --> 00:41:47,285
- I can't.! I can't.!
- Come on! Come on!

347
00:41:47,327 --> 00:41:50,038
Carly, get in!

348
00:42:15,063 --> 00:42:18,358
We gotta find Scott!
We have to find Scott!

349
00:42:29,036 --> 00:42:31,579
Where is he?
Where is he!

350
00:42:34,792 --> 00:42:38,379
There he is!
There he is! Scott!

351
00:42:38,462 --> 00:42:42,216
Run, Scott.!
We're over here.! Scott.!

352
00:42:42,257 --> 00:42:45,844
- Scott.! Come on.!
- Scott, let's go!

353
00:42:45,928 --> 00:42:49,431
- Come on!

354
00:42:49,515 --> 00:42:52,726
- Come on, Scott! Scott!
- Let's go.!

355
00:42:52,768 --> 00:42:55,062
- Scott, come on!
- Come on, Scott!

356
00:42:55,104 --> 00:42:57,898
- Come on, Scott!
- Scott! Scott! What are you doing?

357
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:00,526
- Scott, what's wrong?
- Scott!

358
00:43:00,609 --> 00:43:02,653
Scott! No!

359
00:43:02,736 --> 00:43:05,614
- No!

360
00:43:05,698 --> 00:43:10,536
Let go of me.! Let me go.!

361
00:43:10,578 --> 00:43:13,706
Scott.!

362
00:43:13,789 --> 00:43:16,709
No!

363
00:43:19,045 --> 00:43:21,589
Drive! Drive!

364
00:43:21,672 --> 00:43:23,883
- No!
- Drive!

365
00:43:31,223 --> 00:43:33,142
Oh, God!

366
00:43:34,769 --> 00:43:37,271
What's happening?

367
00:44:02,171 --> 00:44:04,924
Oh, God, what's happening?

368
00:44:08,928 --> 00:44:13,933
Jess, please,
can we go back? Please!

369
00:44:14,017 --> 00:44:17,479
Carly, we have to
keep going. Okay?

370
00:44:21,483 --> 00:44:25,487
Scott.

371
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:45,966
Are you sure this is
the road from that map?

372
00:44:46,049 --> 00:44:48,176
It's gotta go somewhere.

373
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:50,720
This better get us out of here.

374
00:44:56,351 --> 00:44:58,228
Shit.

375
00:45:02,816 --> 00:45:05,694
- Shit!
- Come on!

376
00:45:07,404 --> 00:45:10,824
- Back it up.

377
00:45:13,535 --> 00:45:17,164
- Come on!
- It's not gonna go any farther.
Come on. We have to get out.

378
00:45:21,001 --> 00:45:23,086
We gotta find out
where we are.

379
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:25,173
The highest ridge is up there.
Come on.

380
00:45:25,214 --> 00:45:28,217
What's the point?
They're gonna find us anyway.

381
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:32,346
- Come on. Let's go, Carly.
- No. If he's going, I'm not.
He got us into this.

382
00:45:32,387 --> 00:45:35,809
Carly, look at me, okay?
Scott died protecting us.

383
00:45:35,892 --> 00:45:39,353
We need to keep ourselves alive,
or it was for nothing. Okay?

384
00:45:39,395 --> 00:45:41,688
We're all in this together, Carl.

385
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:43,691
Come on.

386
00:45:43,732 --> 00:45:45,944
I want him back.

387
00:45:46,027 --> 00:45:48,195
Shh.

388
00:45:49,905 --> 00:45:51,908
I know, I know.

389
00:45:54,493 --> 00:45:57,038
- Carl, look at me. Okay? Look.

390
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,540
We're gonna stay alive.
We're gonna get out of this.

391
00:45:59,582 --> 00:46:04,211
We're gonna find the police and
make sure those motherfuckers
are punished for this. Okay?

392
00:46:07,841 --> 00:46:10,092
Carly.

393
00:46:10,134 --> 00:46:13,096
Come on, Carly.
You can do it.

394
00:46:14,805 --> 00:46:17,308
It's gonna get dark soon.
Come on.

395
00:46:20,978 --> 00:46:23,272
We need to find
that road quick.

396
00:46:23,314 --> 00:46:25,274
I know.

397
00:46:55,304 --> 00:46:57,266
Just a little bit farther.

398
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:03,688
Chris!

399
00:47:05,606 --> 00:47:08,735
- It's a bear trap.

400
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:46,232
- What's up?
- I gotta rest.

401
00:47:56,033 --> 00:47:57,993
- Hey, guys.

402
00:47:58,076 --> 00:48:00,538
Look.

403
00:48:02,039 --> 00:48:05,709
Oh my God.
It's a watchtower.

404
00:48:10,297 --> 00:48:12,550
- Hello! Is anyone up there?
- Shh! Shh!

405
00:48:16,261 --> 00:48:19,056
- I don't think anyone's up there.
- Doesn't matter.

406
00:48:19,097 --> 00:48:22,059
It may have a phone or a radio.
Maybe we can see the road.

407
00:48:22,143 --> 00:48:23,728
You okay?

408
00:48:29,025 --> 00:48:31,026
Come on.

409
00:49:27,918 --> 00:49:30,795
Guys, I don't see
any roads or towns out there.

410
00:49:30,836 --> 00:49:33,382
Let's not stand by the window.
They might see us.

411
00:49:41,764 --> 00:49:44,142
- Hey.
- We're all gonna die.

412
00:49:45,935 --> 00:49:48,939
Carly, I need you to come help me
look around, please.

413
00:50:03,202 --> 00:50:05,372
Hey, Chris.

414
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,978
- Jess.
- Thanks.

415
00:51:06,392 --> 00:51:09,270
Oh, my God.
It's a radio.

416
00:51:13,398 --> 00:51:15,735
Thing looks prehistoric.

417
00:51:15,776 --> 00:51:18,528
- Do you know how to use this?
- Uh, let me try.

418
00:51:18,570 --> 00:51:22,200
- It could still work.
- Don't move anything.

419
00:51:22,283 --> 00:51:25,077
- Keep it on the frequency they had it on.
- It works.

420
00:51:25,118 --> 00:51:28,247
Can anybody hear me? We have
an emergency. Can anybody hear me?

421
00:51:28,331 --> 00:51:31,042
Say "Mayday."

422
00:51:31,125 --> 00:51:34,128
Look, we have a huge emergency.
Please, does anybody hear me?

423
00:51:35,462 --> 00:51:37,548
Someone is injured.
We need help.

424
00:51:37,590 --> 00:51:40,634
Hello. Please, is anybody
out there that can hear me?

425
00:51:40,717 --> 00:51:43,805
- Hello.
- No.

426
00:51:46,808 --> 00:51:49,978
Get down.
Cover the light.

427
00:51:50,061 --> 00:51:52,062
Shh.

428
00:52:06,202 --> 00:52:08,621
I think they're passing us.

429
00:52:19,758 --> 00:52:21,676
This is Ranger Base Emergency.
Do you copy?

430
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:25,680
- What is your position? Over.

431
00:52:25,764 --> 00:52:28,308
Do you copy?
What is your position? Over.

432
00:52:28,391 --> 00:52:31,812
- I don't know my position. Just help us.
- Shh.!

433
00:52:31,895 --> 00:52:35,147
I need another copy of that.
I repeat. What is your position?

434
00:52:35,232 --> 00:52:37,359
They're coming.

435
00:52:42,739 --> 00:52:44,866
We don't know our position.
We're in a watchtower.

436
00:52:44,950 --> 00:52:47,452
We must be north
of Bear Mountain Road.

437
00:52:47,536 --> 00:52:51,330
Someone is trying to kill us!
They've murdered our friends!
They're after us right now!

438
00:52:51,415 --> 00:52:54,126
I'm having
some trouble hearing you.

439
00:52:54,209 --> 00:52:56,460
If you're in the tower, stay there.
Do you copy?

440
00:52:56,502 --> 00:52:58,839
Yes, we copy! Just hurry, please!
This is an emergency!

441
00:52:58,922 --> 00:53:01,716
- Help me move this. Come on! Come on!
- We'll come to you.

442
00:53:01,799 --> 00:53:04,219
They're after us.!
Someone's been shot.!

443
00:53:04,303 --> 00:53:07,472
Our friends have been killed,
and we need help.! Please.!

444
00:53:07,514 --> 00:53:09,850
Fuck!

445
00:53:35,334 --> 00:53:37,253
What are they doing?

446
00:53:37,336 --> 00:53:39,338
I don't know.

447
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:45,594
I think they're going down.

448
00:53:45,678 --> 00:53:47,263
Jess.

449
00:54:02,069 --> 00:54:05,406
Hello? Hello?
Is anybody there?

450
00:54:05,489 --> 00:54:07,700
Can you hear us? Hello?

451
00:54:38,106 --> 00:54:41,609
- Jesus, what are they doing?
- We're on fire.

452
00:54:41,693 --> 00:54:44,070
They're trying to burn us out.

453
00:54:46,114 --> 00:54:49,158
Oh, my God.

454
00:54:59,210 --> 00:55:01,629
Carly.!

455
00:55:01,713 --> 00:55:05,258
- Come here!
- Let go of me! Let go!

456
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:08,678
I'd rather jump than burn to death!

457
00:55:10,388 --> 00:55:13,016
- Calm down.
- You're right.

458
00:55:13,099 --> 00:55:15,769
- What?
- She's right.

459
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:19,439
- We have to jump. Those branches
are only a few feet down.
- That's more like 20 feet.

460
00:55:19,481 --> 00:55:23,151
I don't want to burn, and I don't want to
be chopped into pieces. We can do this.

461
00:55:23,234 --> 00:55:25,362
I'll go first.

462
00:55:25,445 --> 00:55:27,364
Chris. Hey.

463
00:55:42,254 --> 00:55:46,466
Oh.

464
00:56:15,245 --> 00:56:18,373
Aaah! Chris!
Chris! Aaah!

465
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:22,669
- Chris!

466
00:56:47,528 --> 00:56:50,030
- You okay?
- Do you think they saw us?

467
00:56:50,114 --> 00:56:53,367
I don't know.

468
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:02,376
We gotta move.
Come on.

469
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:04,629
Shit. Shit.

470
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:24,649
Carly, come on.

471
00:58:30,633 --> 00:58:34,094
I can do this.
I can do this. I can do this.

472
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:36,973
I can...
I can do this.

473
00:58:38,974 --> 00:58:41,142
- Car...

474
00:58:58,536 --> 00:59:00,662
- Shh.

475
00:59:03,499 --> 00:59:07,085
- Come on. Come on.

476
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:31,194
- He's coming.
- I know. I have a plan. Come on.

477
00:59:38,742 --> 00:59:40,745
Jessie, this way.

478
01:00:04,686 --> 01:00:06,729
- Can you hold this?
- Why?

479
01:00:06,854 --> 01:00:10,066
'Cause we're gonna knock this fucker
out of the tree. Can you hold it?

480
01:00:11,901 --> 01:00:15,072
- Yeah.
- All right. Don't let go
until I say so. Okay?

481
01:00:15,155 --> 01:00:19,076
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna make sure he comes this way.

482
01:00:19,117 --> 01:00:21,827
- No. You can't move as quick as I can.
- Jessie.

483
01:00:21,911 --> 01:00:24,831
Jessie.

484
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:47,688
I'm right here!
Come and get me!

485
01:00:51,066 --> 01:00:53,193
Where are you?

486
01:00:56,697 --> 01:00:58,741
Here I am!

487
01:01:31,399 --> 01:01:34,193
- What...

488
01:01:45,413 --> 01:01:48,165
- Hmm?

489
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:57,758
- Hey!

490
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:38,735
Sorry about your friends.

491
01:03:41,488 --> 01:03:45,117
Last Friday I came home,
and there's a message on my machine...

492
01:03:46,285 --> 01:03:49,288
from my boyfriend, who...

493
01:03:49,371 --> 01:03:52,583
says that we shouldn't
be together anymore.

494
01:03:55,836 --> 01:04:00,257
Within 20 minutes
of me... telling Carly...

495
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:07,473
she had Scott and...
Evan and Francine...

496
01:04:07,514 --> 01:04:10,517
all blowing off work this week
to take me out here.

497
01:04:11,727 --> 01:04:14,188
That's just the kind
of friends they were.

498
01:04:17,524 --> 01:04:19,526
And now they're dead.

499
01:04:28,953 --> 01:04:31,204
It's not your fault.

500
01:04:32,998 --> 01:04:35,000
It's not.

501
01:05:00,776 --> 01:05:02,778
They're here!

502
01:05:10,536 --> 01:05:13,539
No, they're not.
You were dreaming.

503
01:05:15,416 --> 01:05:18,044
I wish.

504
01:06:02,088 --> 01:06:04,758
- How's your leg?
- It hurts.

505
01:06:04,841 --> 01:06:08,596
Which is good.
If it didn't hurt... Road.

506
01:06:08,679 --> 01:06:10,764
- What?
- Road. Look.

507
01:06:10,805 --> 01:06:14,476
- We gotta get down there.
- Take that slope right there.

508
01:06:18,271 --> 01:06:20,649
I can't believe it.

509
01:06:20,732 --> 01:06:24,277
- How are we gonna get you down?
- I'll get down...

510
01:06:25,654 --> 01:06:28,365
- Chris!
- Go!

511
01:06:28,448 --> 01:06:31,618
- Chris! No! Chris!

512
01:06:32,702 --> 01:06:35,665
Chris.! Chris.!

513
01:06:35,748 --> 01:06:39,710
Chris! Get off of me!

514
01:06:42,504 --> 01:06:44,131
- Jessie!

515
01:06:44,172 --> 01:06:47,050
Jessie!

516
01:06:56,101 --> 01:06:59,521
Hey, stop!
Oh, thank God!

517
01:06:59,563 --> 01:07:01,523
Are you crazy?

518
01:07:01,565 --> 01:07:04,401
- They took her. Come on. We gotta...
- Just calm down.

519
01:07:04,485 --> 01:07:07,655
- We gotta move.
- Are you one of them folks
who called me from the fire tower?

520
01:07:07,697 --> 01:07:11,492
- Will you shut up and listen.
People are dead!
- Dead? What people?

521
01:09:25,669 --> 01:09:28,547
Help.!

522
01:09:28,631 --> 01:09:30,674
No!

523
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:37,305
- Mmm.
- No.

524
01:09:41,893 --> 01:09:43,980
Help me. Please.

525
01:09:45,356 --> 01:09:48,316
Help me. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

526
01:09:48,358 --> 01:09:52,988
I'm sorry. Yeah?
Can you help me?

527
01:09:53,030 --> 01:09:55,074
Please help me.

528
01:09:56,284 --> 01:09:58,368
No!

529
01:09:59,911 --> 01:10:01,414
No!

530
01:10:17,514 --> 01:10:23,103
Help.

531
01:11:20,159 --> 01:11:23,121
Somebody, help me!

532
01:11:26,875 --> 01:11:28,919
No!

533
01:11:51,232 --> 01:11:53,027
Help me!

534
01:12:47,957 --> 01:12:51,334
- You're okay. Come on.

535
01:12:51,376 --> 01:12:54,839
Just stay with me. You're all right.
Come on. It's okay.

536
01:12:54,881 --> 01:12:57,507
Keep looking at me.
All right? You're okay.

537
01:12:57,549 --> 01:13:00,595
- Thank you.
- Shh. Everything's okay.

538
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:08,603
- Chris.!
-

539
01:14:00,530 --> 01:14:02,949
- Chris!

540
01:14:54,918 --> 01:14:57,838
- Chris.

541
01:15:09,516 --> 01:15:12,227
- Get off of me!

542
01:15:25,157 --> 01:15:27,159
Shoot them.

543
01:15:27,243 --> 01:15:29,495
I only got one shot left.

544
01:15:36,502 --> 01:15:41,173
Come on, you motherfuckers.
Just die.
